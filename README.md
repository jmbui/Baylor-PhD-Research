# Baylor-PhD-Research
This repo contains some of the code developed in association with my Ph.D. Dissertation research. The Neural Network Watchdog, first introduced in 
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12754), is a concept where input data is reconstructed and compared to the original input to determine validity.

The examples provided are meant as high level examples and are not the actual code used to perform the experiments documented in the provided publications and my associated dissertation.
